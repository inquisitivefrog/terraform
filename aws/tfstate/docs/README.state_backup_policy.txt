The description regarding Backup is confusing.   If as you say, anytime I or any other member of my team modifies the environment by changing existing or adding new TF files, then the TFSTATE file will be updated in S3.   So I donâ€™t need to backup the files on disk but I need to periodically dump S3 bucket content to permanent storage such as AWS Glacier?

Answer
------
Let's clarify the backup strategy for your Terraform state:

Understanding the Backup Need:
S3 as State Storage: You're correct; with your current setup, anytime you or your team modifies the environment through Terraform, the terraform.tfstate file in S3 gets updated. This means the primary state is managed remotely, and you don't need to worry about backing up local .tfstate files on your disk since they're not the source of truth anymore.
Version Control: However, you should still version control your .tf files (your Terraform configurations) since they define the infrastructure. This isn't state backup but source code management.

Backup Strategy for S3 Stored State:
S3 Versioning:
Enable Versioning: If you haven't already, enable versioning on your S3 bucket. This automatically keeps multiple versions of your state file. With versioning enabled, each modification to the state file creates a new version, allowing you to revert if necessary.

hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket_versioning" "state_bucket_versioning" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.state_bucket.id
  versioning_configuration {
    status = "Enabled"
  }
}

This was part of your setup, so you're already doing this, which is great for versioning your state changes.
S3 Lifecycle Policies:
Move to Glacier: You can set up S3 lifecycle policies to automatically transition older versions of your state file to AWS Glacier or another colder storage tier for long-term retention at a lower cost. Here's how you might configure this:

hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration" "state_bucket_lifecycle" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.state_bucket.id

  rule {
    id     = "move_to_glacier"
    status = "Enabled"

    noncurrent_version_transition {
      noncurrent_days = 30
      storage_class   = "GLACIER"
    }

    noncurrent_version_expiration {
      noncurrent_days = 365
    }
  }
}

Explanation:
After 30 days, old versions move to Glacier for long-term archival.
After 365 days, these versions expire. Adjust these times based on how long you need to keep state history.
Manual Snapshots:
For critical points in your project (like before major releases or upgrades), you might manually copy the state file to another secure location or another S3 bucket configured for long-term storage.
Security and Access Control:
Ensure that access to both the S3 bucket for current use and the Glacier archive is tightly controlled. Only necessary personnel should have access to these resources.

Summary:
Primary State Management: Relies on S3 with versioning enabled.
Long-term Backup: Use lifecycle policies to automatically archive to Glacier for long-term, cost-effective storage.
Manual Backups: For critical moments, consider manual copying of state files to another secure storage.

With this approach, you balance the active management of your infrastructure state with cost-effective, long-term backup solutions. Remember, Glacier has retrieval times, so these backups are for disaster recovery or audits, not for immediate operational needs.

The suggested support for AWS Glacier should be added to the create_bucket.tf?

Answer
------
Yes, you would add the support for AWS Glacier by including an S3 lifecycle configuration in your create_bucket.tf file. Here's how you can modify or extend your existing create_bucket.tf to include this lifecycle rule:

hcl
# ... [previous resources]

resource "aws_s3_bucket_versioning" "state_bucket_versioning" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.state_bucket.id
  versioning_configuration {
    status = "Enabled"
  }
}

# Add this new resource for lifecycle configuration
resource "aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration" "state_bucket_lifecycle" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.state_bucket.id

  rule {
    id     = "move_to_glacier"
    status = "Enabled"

    noncurrent_version_transition {
      noncurrent_days = 30
      storage_class   = "GLACIER"
    }

    noncurrent_version_expiration {
      noncurrent_days = 365
    }
  }
}

# ... [other resources like aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration, etc.]

Explanation:
Versioning: You already have versioning enabled with aws_s3_bucket_versioning. This ensures that every change to an object creates a new version, which can then be transitioned to Glacier.
Lifecycle Configuration: The aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration resource defines how objects in your S3 bucket transition over time:
noncurrent_version_transition: After 30 days of being non-current, these versions of the terraform.tfstate file will move to Glacier.
noncurrent_version_expiration: After an additional 335 days in Glacier (for a total of 365 days since becoming non-current), these versions will be deleted. This helps manage storage costs by eventually removing old versions.

Considerations:
Adjust Timings: The 30 and 365 days are examples. Adjust these based on how long you need to retain state history or how quickly you want to reduce costs by moving to Glacier.
Cost: Remember, there's a retrieval fee from Glacier, so this setup is more for long-term archival than frequent access. Use it for disaster recovery or compliance purposes.
Security: Ensure that your Glacier archive has proper security settings, like encryption and access controls, matching or exceeding those of your S3 bucket.
Testing: Test this setup in a non-production environment first to understand how it affects your workflow, especially if you ever need to recover from Glacier.

By adding this configuration, you'll have your Terraform state files automatically backed up to Glacier for long-term retention, enhancing your backup strategy while keeping operational costs in check.

Do I retrieve data from Glacier based on S3 bucket name?

Answer
======
No, you don't directly retrieve data from Glacier based solely on the S3 bucket name. When objects are transitioned to Glacier from S3 due to lifecycle policies, they remain associated with the S3 bucket but become stored in Glacier. Here's how the process works:

Retrieving Data from Glacier:
Initiate a Restore Job:
When you want to access data that's been moved to Glacier, you first need to initiate a restore job for that specific object. This is done through the S3 API or AWS Management Console by selecting the object in your S3 bucket:
S3 Console: Navigate to your S3 bucket, find the object, and choose "Restore" from the object's context menu.
AWS CLI: Use the aws s3api restore-object command, specifying the bucket name, key of the object, and the desired restore tier (e.g., Bulk, Standard, or Expedited).

Example CLI command:
bash
aws s3api restore-object --bucket bluedragon-employer-prod --key path/to/your/statefile --restore-request '{"Days":5,"GlacierJobParameters":{"Tier":"Standard"}}'

Days: Number of days you want the data to be accessible after restore.
Tier: Determines how quickly you want your data restored (Expedited is fastest but more expensive).
Wait for the Data to Become Available:
Depending on the restore tier you chose, it could take anywhere from minutes (Expedited) to hours (Standard, Bulk) for the data to become available. Glacier restore times are:
Expedited: 1-5 minutes
Standard: 3-5 hours
Bulk: 5-12 hours
Access the Restored Data:
Once the restore job is complete, the data will be temporarily copied back to the S3 bucket in the STANDARD storage class for the duration you specified. You can then access this data directly from your S3 bucket like any other object.
Check Restore Status:
You can check the status of your restore job with:
bash
aws s3api head-object --bucket bluedragon-employer-prod --key path/to/your/statefile
Look for the Restore header in the response to see if the restore is in progress or completed.

Key Points:
Object Key: You'll need the exact key of the object in S3 to initiate the restore, not just the bucket name.
Temporary Availability: The data is restored temporarily. After the specified number of days, the object will revert back to Glacier unless you restore it again.
Cost: Remember that restoring from Glacier incurs retrieval costs, so plan your restores accordingly.
Glacier for Long-term: Glacier is intended for archival, not for frequent access, so this process isn't meant for regular operational use but for recovery or when you absolutely need historical data.

By understanding this workflow, you can manage your Terraform state backups in Glacier effectively while being aware of the retrieval process and its implications.

How do I confirm that it is working?   Inspect objects in an S3 bucket?

Answer
------
To confirm that your S3 lifecycle policy for moving objects to Glacier is working, you can inspect the objects in your S3 bucket using either the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDKs. Here's how to do it with both the Console and CLI:

Using AWS Management Console:
Navigate to Your S3 Bucket:
Go to the AWS Management Console and select S3.
Find and click on your bucket (bluedragon-employer-prod or whatever you named it).
Check Object Details:
Look for the objects that you expect to have been transitioned to Glacier. You might need to navigate through your folder structure if you're using one.
Click on an object to see its details.
Storage Class: If it says "GLACIER", the object has been transitioned.
Versioning: If versioning is enabled, you can see different versions of an object. Check if older versions have been moved to Glacier.
Check Lifecycle Rules:
In the bucket settings, under "Management", you should see your lifecycle rules listed. Ensure they are active.

Using AWS CLI:
List Objects and Check Storage Class:
Use aws s3 ls with the --recursive flag to list all objects, including their storage class:
bash
aws s3 ls s3://bluedragon-employer-prod/ --recursive --human-readable --summarize

This command will list all objects in your bucket. Look for the "GLACIER" storage class next to objects.
Check Individual Objects:
To get more detailed information about a specific object's storage class, use:
bash
aws s3api head-object --bucket bluedragon-employer-prod --key path/to/your/statefile

In the output, look for the StorageClass property. If it says "GLACIER", the object has been transitioned.
Check Lifecycle Configuration:
To confirm your lifecycle policy is set up correctly:
bash
aws s3api get-bucket-lifecycle-configuration --bucket bluedragon-employer-prod

This will return the lifecycle rules for your bucket, showing you the transition rules to Glacier.
Versioning and Noncurrent Versions:
If versioning is enabled, you can check noncurrent versions:
bash
aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket bluedragon-employer-prod --prefix path/to/your/statefile

Look for versions where IsLatest is false and check their StorageClass.

Confirmation:
Look for GLACIER: If you see objects with a storage class of "GLACIER", your lifecycle rule is working.
Time Check: Ensure the time since the last modification of the object corresponds with the noncurrent_days you set in your lifecycle rule (e.g., 30 days before transitioning to Glacier).
Test with a New Object: If you're unsure, you can test by uploading a new object, waiting for the transition period, and then checking its storage class.

By following these steps, you should be able to confirm whether your S3 bucket's lifecycle policy is effectively moving objects to Glacier as intended.
