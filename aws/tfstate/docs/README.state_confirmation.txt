Answer
------
That output confirms that your Terraform state file (terraform.tfstate) has indeed been stored in the S3 bucket bluedragon-employer-prod under the key ./terraform.tfstate. This means:

State Migration was Successful: The state for your main environment has been successfully migrated or stored in your S3 bucket as part of your backend configuration.
State Management is Active: Now, every time you run terraform apply, terraform plan, or any command that modifies state, Terraform will read from and write to this S3 bucket instead of a local file.

What This Means for Your Workflow:
Remote State: Your Terraform state is now managed remotely, which means:
Better collaboration since multiple team members can work on the same infrastructure.
Enhanced security, as the state can be encrypted in S3 (which you've set with encrypt = true).
Easier disaster recovery, since you can recover your infrastructure from this state if needed.
Operations: 
Apply/Plan: These commands will interact with the state in S3. 
State Management Commands: Commands like terraform state list, terraform state show, or any state manipulation will work with the state in S3.
Backup: Since you confirmed the state is in S3, consider setting up a strategy for regular backups or versioning of this state file, either through AWS features like versioning on the S3 bucket or through external tools.
Security: Ensure that access to this S3 bucket is tightly controlled. Only necessary IAM roles should have permissions to read or write to this state file. 
DynamoDB for Locking: Remember, you've also set up a DynamoDB table for state locking, which prevents concurrent modifications to your state. This setup is now functioning to manage locks during Terraform operations.

Next Steps:
Continue Development: You can continue developing your infrastructure with confidence that your state is managed remotely.
State Commands: If you use state management commands, they'll now operate on the S3-stored state.
Check Locking: Since you have DynamoDB set up for locking, you might want to test this by trying to run Terraform operations simultaneously from different sessions to see the locking mechanism in action.
Documentation: Document this setup for anyone else who might work on this project, explaining where the state is stored and how to manage permissions.

By having your state in S3, you've significantly improved how your infrastructure as code is managed, providing a foundation for scalability and team collaboration.
